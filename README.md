# OooShiny Code of Conduct

## Community

OooShiny represents a diverse group of artists, designers, engineers, developers, creators, curators and others interested in discussing art and technology topics. The list is member managed and owned.

Your voice is always welcome. It's natural to feel intimidated when posting to a group of peers as large as OooShiny. Even if you’re lurking, your presence is appreciated!

## Origin

The OooShiny mailing list was originally created in San Francisco in 2007 to complement a real-life meetup where members were encouraged to present their work to a small, supportive audience. Over time a community was built around sharing work and evolved to became a resource for technical knowledge and job/gig listings. Because members have been encouraged to invite others, the list grew organically to what it is now. Members are encouraged to organize and host their own meetups by posting to the list.

## Rules

1. **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:
    - Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, background, or any other minority group or protected class
    - Threats of violence
    - Deliberate intimidation
    - Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Stalking or following
    - Any other kind of harassment
2. **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
3. **Be encouraging.** Share your knowledge. Prop up those who need support. Go out of your way to support and mentor those who are unseen or unheard.
4. **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. Be mindful of sarcasm and snark that detract from or derail the conversation in a negative way. Trolling and personal attacks are forbidden.
5. **Be exemplary and remember the person**. When you communicate to other people on this list, you must ask yourself “Would I say this to the person's face in front of a group of my respected peers, mentors, teachers, and students?”
6. **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.
7. **Keep it on-topic.** Consider if what you say serves the intent of the original post. If not, create a new thread.
8. **Speak up.** If you see bad behavior, please call it out with a link to this document, and/or notify the moderators at [oooshiny.mods@gmail.com](oooshiny.mods@gmail.com).

## Moderation

Should you experience anything that violates this code, or makes you feel unwelcome on the list, please contact the moderators at [oooshiny.mods@gmail.com](oooshiny.mods@gmail.com).

## Adding New Members

OooShiny is always growing! Existing members can invite new members by the following procedure:

1. Send their email and name to the list moderators at [oooshiny.mods@gmail.com](oooshiny.mods@gmail.com).
2. Wait until the new member notifies you that they have received and accepted an invite to the list.
3. Post a courteous, professional, and supportive welcome thread to the list to give the new member visibility and tag your subject line by prefixing it with **[Intro]**.

Members are encouraged to reply with a welcome message to [Intro] threads, even if they don't already know the person being introduced!

## Subject Line Tags

Make use of bracket tags to allow other members to filter your post:

- **[Job Spam]**[:location, :type, :etc] For gigs, jobs. Optionally you can list the location, type of gig, or any other details in a bracket tag.
- **[Intro]** For new member introduction threads
- **[Meetup]** Info about real-life meetups.
